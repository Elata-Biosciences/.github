[Elata](https://www.elata.bio/) is a decentralized research and engineering collective dedicated to accelerating breakthroughs in precision psychiatry and computational neuroscience. We operate at the intersection of open-source neural and biomedical engineering, decentralized science, and cryptographic privacy technologies. Elata's mission is to power the entire ecosystem end-to-end - comprising researchers, clinicians, and citizens - with enhanced capabilities for understanding, measuring, and ultimately improving the way conditions are treated.

## Focus Areas

* **Quantitative and Computational Psychiatry:**
  The overarching goal of Elata is to support deeply innovative R&D aimed at tailoring mental health treatments using biomarkers, neuroimaging, and machine learning.

* **Open Neurotechnology:**
  Elata develops affordable, privacy-respecting tools like the [Elata Open EEG](https://github.com/Elata-Biosciences/elata-eeg) to enable decentralized collection of neuroimaging data at massive scale.

* **Decentralization:**
   Given the deeply consequential nature of neurotechnology and brain/behavior-based interventions, Elata's governance process is transparent, decentralized and directed by ELTA token holders, making it so anyone can participate. 

* **Privacy and Encryption:**
  Elata integrates capabilities such as zero-knowledge proofs, PGP encryption, and decentralized storage to guarantee participant confidentiality and data sovereignty spanning different R&D initiatives.
