# Elata Biosciences

**Elata Biosciences** is a decentralized research and engineering collective dedicated to accelerating breakthroughs in **precision psychiatry** and **computational neuroscience**. We operate at the intersection of **open-source bioengineering**, **decentralized science (DeSci)**, and **cryptographic privacy technologies**. Our mission is to empower researchers, clinicians, and citizens with new tools to understand, measure, and improve mental health.

## 🔬 Our Focus Areas

* **Precision Psychiatry**
  We support research and innovation aimed at tailoring mental health treatments using biomarkers, neuroimaging, and machine learning.

* **Open Neurotechnology**
  We develop affordable, privacy-respecting tools like the [**Elata OpenEEG**](https://github.com/Elata-Biosciences/elata-eeg) to enable decentralized data collection and mental health diagnostics.

* **Decentralized Science (DeSci)**
  We coordinate funding, community governance, and protocol development through on-chain systems that align incentives between researchers and patients.

* **Privacy & Cryptography**
  We integrate tools like **zero-knowledge proofs**, **PGP encryption**, and **decentralized storage** to ensure participant confidentiality and data sovereignty.
